Hi! I am Jiaqi Xiong (熊嘉琪)

I am an incoming Master student in Social Data Science at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, starting this October. I obtained my dual bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Aberdeen (with first degree honour) and South China Normal University (SCNU) in 2025, supervised by [Chris Norval](http://cnorval.com/). Currently, my research interest focus on **Graph Neural Network**, **AI for Science** and **Trustworthy AI** (equivalent).
