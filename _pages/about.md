Hi! I am Jiaqi Xiong (熊嘉琪)

I am an incoming Master student in Social Data Science at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, starting this October. I obtained my dual bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Aberdeen (with first-degree honours) and South China Normal University (SCNU) in 2025, where I completed my thesis under supervision of [Chris Norval](http://cnorval.com/). My research focuses on **graph neural networks (GNNs)** and **AI for Science**, especially DNA/RNA foundation models and the application of GNNs to biological sciences and sports analytics. I also maintain active interests in multi-agent systems and trustworthy AI.
